#Testing Plan

* Test each of my view functions:
    * Test that my list_entry returns the list of journal entries.
    * Test that list_entry returns the data I inteded for.
    * Test that detail view shows the details for the correct journal entry.
    * Test that creating a new entry creates the entry I intended and persists the data in my database.
    * Test that I can get an entry, edit it, and commit it to the database.
